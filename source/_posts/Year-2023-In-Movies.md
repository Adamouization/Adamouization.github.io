In 2023, I watched less movies than I did I previous years (likely due to the good weather and Covid not being a thing anymore). I watched a total of 68 movies (110 in 2022, 123 in 2021 and 137 in 2020), which amounted to:
* 138.1 hours watch time
* 5.7 movies on average per month (1.3 per week)

I watched more movies on Sundays and Mondays, and the least on Thursdays:

Of all the movies I watched, "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" was the highest rate on Letterboxd, whereas "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania" was the lowest rated:

Since 2019, I have been tracking every movie I watched via Letterboxd, an online social cataloguing service. You can add me here: https://letterboxd.com/adamouization/. You can see the full year in movie here: https://letterboxd.com/adamouization/year/2023/.
