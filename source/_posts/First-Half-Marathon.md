I recently completed my first half-marathon (21.1km or 13.2 miles) in December: the London Richmond Half-Marathon!

I had initially set out to complete this challenge in the first half of 2022, but got injured during the race (only completed 8km before my knee let go). This was due to poor training intensity and poor running form. A long break from running and many physio sessions later and I was finally able to complete my first race.

I had initially set the goal of completing it in sub-2h (after seeing how well the training was going as I was finally running correctly), but discovered a couple of weeks before that the race was classified as a "trail" run with a lot of elevation changes. So I had to accept the reality that I had trained for a flat race but was about to face a hilly one, and therefore removed the sub-2h idea from my head to avoid a repeat of my 2022 attempt. Here is the Strava post with a lot of details of each split:

My goal so far for 2024 are to:

1. Participate in another half-marathon (a flat one this time) and attempt to finish it in less than 2 hours
2. Complete a triathlon (Olympic distance) to learn some new skills (cycling and swimming)
