My name is Adam, and I currently live in London (UK) and grew up in Monaco. I am a data scientist with many niche hobbies that I want to share here. 

You can explore some these hobbies through this website, which is themed using a <a href="https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386" target="_blank">Bootstrap/386</a> theme, a vintage 1980s DOS-inspired Twitter theme. I wanted to emulate the earlier days of having a static personal website (similar to GeoCities) with poor but simple layouts filled with iframe widgets and a guestbook. But I wanted to do so while leveraging modern technologies like Bootstrap, Node JS and Hexo to make it more elegant and simpler to deploy and maintain. You can find the code I wrote for this website here: https://github.com/Adamouization/Adamouization.github.io.
