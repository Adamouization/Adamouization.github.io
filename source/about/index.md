My name is Adam, and I currently live in London (UK) and grew up in Monaco. I am a data scientist with many niche hobbies that I like sharing here.

You can explore some these hobbies through this old-school website, which is themed using the <a href="https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386" target="_blank">Bootstrap/386</a> theme, a vintage 1980s  DOS-inspired Twitter theme. I wanted to emulate the early web days of having a static vanilla HTML and CSS website with simple layouts filled with too many iframe widgets and a guestbook anyone could sign. But I wanted to do so while leveraging modern technologies like Bootstrap, Node JS, Hexo and GitHub Actions to make the solution more elegant and simpler to deploy and maintain. You can find the code that powers this website here: https://github.com/Adamouization/Adamouization.github.io.
