My name is Adam, and I am a data scientist with many niche hobbies. Explore some these hobbies through this website/blog, which is themed using <a href="https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386" target="_blank">Bootstrap/386</a>, a vintage 1980s DOS inspired Twitter Bootstrap theme. You can find the code I wrote for this website here: https://github.com/Adamouization/Adamouization.github.io.
