<h1 id="T-Munzner’s-principles-of-expressiveness-and-effectiveness"><a href="#T-Munzner’s-principles-of-expressiveness-and-effectiveness" class="headerlink" title="T. Munzner’s principles of expressiveness and effectiveness"></a>T. Munzner’s principles of expressiveness and effectiveness</h1><h2 id="Expressiveness"><a href="#Expressiveness" class="headerlink" title="Expressiveness"></a>Expressiveness</h2><p>The principal of effectiveness is followed as the chosen visual variables express all of the data (Appendix B). Additionally, unordered data is not visualised in a way that implies ordering, and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="Effectiveness"><a href="#Effectiveness" class="headerlink" title="Effectiveness"></a>Effectiveness</h2><p>Munzner breaks down the principles of effectiveness into the following categories [2]:</p>
<h3 id="Accuracy"><a href="#Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Accuracy"></a>Accuracy</h3><p>The visualisation follows Cleveland and McGill’s experiments, depicting how “aligned positions against a common scale” yields maximum accuracy [3]. At the top of the Munzner ranking of visual variables effectiveness, “position on common scale” (ordered attributes) and “colour hue” (categorical attributes) are found and both used in the visualisation. However, “shape” is ranked as the least effective, therefore partially violating the principle as it is used repeatedly in the visualisation.</p>
<h3 id="Discriminability"><a href="#Discriminability" class="headerlink" title="Discriminability"></a>Discriminability</h3><p>Data encoded using identical visual variables does not exceed five bins, thus following this principle. This is reinforced when the visualisation is read by section (A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C) and not as whole. If the visualisation&#x2F;legend were not separated into three sections, the visualisation might violate this principle through the considerable use of different hues and shapes.</p>
<h3 id="Separability"><a href="#Separability" class="headerlink" title="Separability"></a>Separability</h3><p>Attributes using shapes and hues often interfere with one another in this visualisation, but both the use of position along the lines and the detailed legend help follow the principle. Additionally, the poor combinations stated by Munzner (hue&#x2F;position, size&#x2F;hue) are not used.</p>
<h3 id="Popout"><a href="#Popout" class="headerlink" title="Popout"></a>Popout</h3><p>This principle is followed through the use of hue to distinguish my own travel habits among the CS5044 students.</p>
<h3 id="Grouping"><a href="#Grouping" class="headerlink" title="Grouping"></a>Grouping</h3><p>The data is grouped by being placed along lines which encode carbon footprint scales, and the visualisation is divided into three distinct sections, thus following the grouping principle.</p>
<br>

<h1 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h1><p>The main advantage of the visualisation is that it always directly compares my personal footprint to others’ in a linear fashion, allowing readers to start with the general footprint comparisons, followed by personal flights in the past year in relation to the average CS5044 student, and ending with personal travel habits compared to CS5044 students. Another advantage is the use of shape enumeration to accurately relay information e.g. the exact carbon footprint in tonnes, the number of flights, the number of students travelling by car&#x2F;motorbike&#x2F;on foot, and the hours spent on train&#x2F;bus commutes, can all be precisely counted in the sketch. Additionally, the visualisation is sketched in a combined view rather than separating the information being visualised.</p>
<p>The main limitation comes with the amount of detail generated by the use of shapes to enumerate the amount of carbon footprint in tonnes or the travel habits of the CS5044 students, which may be difficult to read as it requires multiple cognitive skills (attention, perception and processing) due to potentially high interference. Additionally, the large number of shapes&#x2F;hues could prove difficult to read for some, and the visualisation does not always follow Munzner’s definition of effectiveness.</p>
<p>In comparison to the WWF visualisations (see Appendix A), the sketch conveys more detailed information into a single view, whereas the WWF separates the overall carbon footprint and the lifestyle aspects breakdown. However, the WWF uses powerful visual variables in simple manners to display the information effectively, making use of size and shape for the actual footprints, as well as position and colour hues for additional clarity, whereas more advanced combinations are used in the sketch.</p>
<p>This exercise taught me to force myself to brainstorm new visualisations through different visual variables in order to weight all options available to me. It also taught me that in the context of information visualisation, readability is more important than aesthetics, and to not be afraid of starting over until a visualisation that I am satisfied with is achieved. Finally, it also taught me that I need to fly planes less often (or at least try to offset my flights).</p>
